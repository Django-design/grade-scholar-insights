# Supabase Integration for Email and WhatsApp Lead Management

To fully implement the email and WhatsApp contact functionality requested, you'll need to:

1. Connect your Lovable project to Supabase by clicking the green Supabase button in the top right of the interface.

2. After connecting, create a table in Supabase called `scholarship_leads` with these fields:
   - id (uuid, primary key)
   - name (text)
   - email (text)
   - phone (text)
   - country (text)
   - education_level (text)
   - interested_degree (text)
   - created_at (timestamp with timezone)

3. Create a Supabase Edge Function that sends emails with the scholarship results to the applicant. 
   The Edge Function can use services like SendGrid, Resend or Postmark for email delivery.

4. For WhatsApp integration, create a second Edge Function that integrates with the WhatsApp Business API or a service like Twilio.

These steps are required to implement actual email sending and WhatsApp messaging functionality. The current UI is already set up to capture the required information.
